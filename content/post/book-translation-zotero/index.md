APA 7ed cite and reference book republished in translation this way:

Piaget, J., & Inhelder, B. (1969). *The psychology of the child* (H. Weaver, Trans.; 2nd ed.). Basic Books. (Original work published 1966)

**Parenthetical citation:** (Piaget & Inhelder, 1966/1969) 
**Narrative citation:** Piaget and Inhelder (1966/1969)

To get Zotero set zotero to give you a translation exactly like this, just tkae the following steps:
1. After adding the `Author`s, include one more `Author` area, and change it to `Translator`, add the translators name.
2. in the `Extra` field, add `original-date: 1982` (put the specific data).
Done.

``` 
original-title: Type the original title here
original-publisher: Type the original publisher here
original-publisher-place: Type the original place here
original-date: 1982 
```
